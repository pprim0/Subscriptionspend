## Self-Hosting
Just execute the `compose.yaml` 

```sh
$ docker compose up -d
```

For local Docker Compose usage, the auth stack defaults to `http://localhost:4000` and falls back to a development-only `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` if none is provided. Set your own `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` before building for any non-local deployment.

If your production web and API run on different subdomains, also set `BETTER_AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN` to the shared parent domain, for example `example.com`. Without that, the auth cookie can stay scoped to the API host, which breaks SSR and server actions on the web host even though client-side sign-in appears to work.

## Development
Install dependencies and run the workspace with `pnpm` on Node 22:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Techstack
- pnpm workspaces on Node.js 22
- Tanstack Start + React 19 for the web app
- Bun + Hono for the API runtime
- Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI, and shadcn-style components for the UI
- oRPC + Zod for shared contracts and type-safe API calls
- Drizzle ORM with `postgres` and PostgreSQL for the database layer
- Better Auth for authentication
- Docker Compose for simple self-hosting
